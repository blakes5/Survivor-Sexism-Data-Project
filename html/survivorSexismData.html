<div id="strong-works" class="cell markdown">
<p>Let's talk about my favorite television show, Survivor! It's been
around for 20 years, it has 40 seasons, and yes, it is still going on
(Season 41 is being filmed as I type this!). For those who do not know,
Survivor is a reality television show and social strategy game where
they put between 16-20 strangers (well, usually strangers) on an island
(or desert, rainforest, etc.) and they have to live with each other in
their own little society. The fun part about Survivor is they get to
vote people off of their tribe and do not live with them anymore. They
start off split into (2-4) tribes and have challenges, with the losing
tribe going to "Tribal Council", the place where they vote someone off.
Eventually, they merge into 1 tribe and keep voting people off until
there are only 2 or 3 people left. The people who have been voted off
make up the jury and they vote for someone in the final 2/3 to win the
season. And that's a qick gist of Survivor!</p>
<p>Now even though it is my favorite show, it does come with its
problems. One of the main ones is an inequality between men and women in
Survivor. This exists in both the game of Survivor, in terms of how fair
it is for men versus women, as well as in the show of Survivor, in how
men versus women are portrayed on television.</p>
<p>Also, there is a monumental distinction to make between the game of
Survivor and the show of Survivor. The game of Survivor is what happens
out there on the island and how the production behind the scenes
controls the game, through different twists and such. While the show of
Survivor is the product that we, as the viewer, see on television. The
show is a product of what happens in the game (for that season) and is
the result of cutting hundreds of hours of footage to display exactly
what they want to show to the viewer. This distinction between the game
and the show of Survivor is extremely important to clarify for this
project.</p>
<p>That distinction being made, there appears to be inherent sexism in
many facets of the game of Survivor that benefit men. And in the show of
Survivor that we watch, men are the ones who are more often given more
screentime and are given more of a chance to explain their side of the
narrative.</p>
<p>Also, a note on what I mentioned about cutting hundreds of hours of
footage and why that matters. Each season lasts 39 days and there are 13
or 14 episodes every season. So, on average, one 42 minute episode
contains footage from about 3 days worth of gameplay, or 72 hours. And
that is just counting 1 camera ... they have many, many cameras. So, the
producers and editors have a boatlad of footage to use however they want
to display their reality television characters. This means, not
everything shown has to be entirely truthful or presented to us in the
correct order that it happened. For example, they could get clip of
Jessica saying how annoying Phillip is on Day 20 and edit that to put it
in the episode covering Day 10 and try to build up a (fake) storyline
that Jessica wants to get Phillip out on Day 10. And this is the reality
of reality television.</p>

</div>
<div id="eastern-yorkshire" class="cell markdown">
<p>Survivor can often be viewed as a microcosm of society. As in, the
disparity between men and women here in Survivor represents a bigger
issue about society as whole. Most of the imbalances that exist in
Survivor are because of their existence in society as a whole too,
beyond just Survivor. As in, the way women are perceived compared to men
in the real world translate to how their are perceived in the context of
Survivor. So, when I dive into how women are portrayed on Survivor, that
is relevant because it is connected to our pre-conceived beliefs of
societal gender roles and has a much bigger impact than just on the game
of Survivor. The data and information I will present in this project
reflect some of the inherent bias in how we perceive men and women, at
least in the more quantifiable ways. This will still be much more of a
data-driven project, rather than a philosophical paper on gender roles,
but it is important to draw the connection between sexism in Survivor
and how that translates to sexism in real life.</p>
<p>And the gender roles we see play out in Survivor can even have an
impact on society. All 40 seasons of Survivor have pulled in millions of
viewers, with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series)">over
50 million in the finale of the first season</a> back in 2000, to a
steady 7-8 million now. So, this is a show that has a <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/05/29/survivor-changed-television-forever-and-it-still-endures-whats-the-secret/">large
influence on people</a>, <a
href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2020/5/12/21255075/survivor-legacy-40th-anniversary-reality-tv">especially
in American culture</a>. The point is, people love Survivor (myself
included!). And when people see men get rewarded and women get punished
for more aggressive behavior in the game of Survivor, that builds up the
narrative that it should be that way in society. This perpetuates the
standard of men having power and being in higher-level positions more
than women. Of course, there are many more factors beyond just Survivor,
but with how large of a following it has, it definitely has an impact on
society.</p>

</div>
<div id="cosmetic-cardiff" class="cell markdown">
<p>Despite all the progress made in the past 100 or so years, sexism is
still a prevalent issue in American society, especially in the
workplace. Women experience some level of discrimination at work for
their gender, with <a
href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/12/14/gender-discrimination-comes-in-many-forms-for-todays-working-women/">42%
of women</a> reporting they have been discriminated against because of
their gender. Discrimination comes in the form of women receiving less
support from senior leaders than men, receiving unwanted sexual advances
from men, and experiencing sexual harassment or abuse in the workplace.
Sexism has become so interwoven into the environment of a workplace,
that women come to understand it and expect it. <a
href="https://www.smartcompany.com.au/people-human-resources/six-common-manifestations-everyday-sexism-work/">For
example</a>, women might have to ask a male colleague to propose an idea
at a meeting because they know a man's voice might have more volume
(social volume, not just being loud) and be listened to more. Or it also
comes in the form of asking for a manager and expecting to see a man,
even when a woman greets you as the manager. These are just a couple
common examples of how sexism exists and is perpetuated in society,
specifically in a workplace setting.</p>

<p>In Survivor, 2 or 3 players survive long enough to make it to the
final tribal council, where the jury (the most recent 8 or so players
that have been voted out) votes for who they think should win. Each jury
member gets 1 vote and the player with the most votes wins the season. A
jury member's reasoning for who he/she votes for really can be whatever
that person wants. Often times, it comes down to perception of who
played the "best game", which takes into account social relationships
between players. As the game of Survivor has developed, jury members
often base their decisions on who to vote for by considering who should
get the credit for social and strategic moves that occur throughout the
game. This is where the idea of <a
href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/12/171213130252.htm">women
getting less credit than men in the workplace</a> really reflects itself
in Survivor. Analyzing how men versus women are perceived in the final
jury vote in Survivor quantifiably represents the potential disparity of
credit or respect that women get compared to men in the real world,
especially in the workplace. So, when we see women generally receiving
less votes to win (at final tribal council), that can be representative
of receiving less credit compared to men in a group setting in real life
(beyond Survivor). The gender stereotypes that predicate that bias in
Survivor are also existent in society, which is what makes the analysis
of this question so relevant in today's world.</p>
<p>Confessionals are one of the largest components of the show of
Survivor. A typical episode of Survivor consists of a mix of
confessionals, clips from life at each tribe camp, challenges, and
tribal council. Confessionals are how players tell their side of the
story to the audience, to give them more perspective on what is
happening in the game. By the nature of the game, the winner of the
season is around the whole season and is usually included in the episode
to, in some sense, explain why he/she is doing this and to narrate along
the way how he/she intend to keep going to win the game. This is
relevant because seeing how many confessionals men winners versus women
winners have can quantify how much of their story they get to tell. For
example, if we see 100 confessionals from Rob, we get to see so much of
what he was thinking every step of the game. But if we see only 15
confessionals from Miranda, we barely get to see what she is thinking
and what her story is. This is relevant beyond Survivor because it
represents a bigger issue of the world being <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/23/truth-world-built-for-men-car-crashes">built
for men</a>. So many things in the world, like car safety mechanism
measurements and police body armour for example, are designed for men.
This happens because the perspective of men has been taken to represent
humans as a whole. So, when a male winner gets to explain much more of
his story in one season than a female winner gets to in another season,
this symbolizes a bigger problem of the world being "set up" for men.
This dichotomy of winning men versus winning women getting confessionals
is of concern because it further perpetuates the narrative in life of
being from a man's perspective by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series)#U.S._television_ratings">several
millions of viewers</a> of Survivor seeing more men tell the stories
than women. And also with <a
href="https://www.truedorktimes.com/s40/recaps/bipoc-stats.htm">mainly
men behind the camera</a> and production of the show, their willingness
to portray more of men's stories further perpetuates this problem in
society and enables it to continue.</p>
<p>In the game of Survivor, hidden immunity idols and individual
immunity challenges represent an opportunity to gain power in the game.
Winning individual immunity guarantees a player's safety from
elimination that round of voting, while an idol nullifies all votes
against the player it is played for, keeping that person also safe from
elimination for that round of voting. This means players who win
challenges and/or find idols are in poisitions of power in the game,
both with safety for that round, and socially with other players. If men
have an advantage in finding idols and winning challenges, then they
have an advantage in acquiring social and strategic power in the game of
Survivor. This can be representative of an inequality in society,
especially in the workplace. Specifically, <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-women-almost-never-become-ceo-2016-9">men
have an easier time getting promotions</a> than women do in the
corporate world. Women work in executive positions much less than men
do, and for each higher level position, a <a
href="https://i.insider.com/5e7d06081378e3047b15a975?width=700&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp">lower
percentage of women</a> are working in it. With this structure of men
already being in higher level positions more, and those same men being
the ones to promote others to higher positions, this perpetuates the
cycle of men being the ones in those CEO, VP, Manager roles. Both the
corporate structure of America and these facets of the game of Survivor
(idols and challenges) seem to historically benefit men, putting them in
power positions in the game and in real life. Which is why I want to
analyze how men versus women have faired in finding idols and winning
individual immunity challenges; because it represents a larger-scale
issue of a system that ameliorates men's opportunities.

<h2 id="datasets-i-will-use">Datasets I will use</h2>
</div>
<div id="mysterious-exchange" class="cell markdown">
<p>I have been collecting data on various topics in Survivor for the
past few years and compiled them <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gb377DdGNfzct0Nt9BYMF-moLXcxFxhOnePBQhIJ73s/edit?usp=sharing">in
this spreadsheet</a>. The pink tabs are the ones I will use for this
project, which are "Confessional Counts of Winners", "Idols Found",
"Individual Immunity Wins (Season)", and "Votes at Final Tribal
Council". All of these will be used to answer the research questions</p>
<p>A considerable amount of the data in that spreadsheet comes from my
own knowledge and memory of having watched every season of Survivior and
somehow remembering loads of minute details. While there is plenty of
footage that is scrapped and does not make the final cut of the episodes
of Survivor, this data is entirely based on concrete events that occur
in the episodes that are aired on CBS. The number of confessionals by
player, hidden immunity idols found, individual immunity challenges won,
votes at final tribal council, and final 4 fire making challenge always
occur within the aired episodes. I considered including individual
reward challenges (another type of challenge besides immunity that
occurs occasionally), but not all reward challenges are always aired in
the episodes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page">Survivor
Wiki</a> and <a
href="http://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/boxscores/index.htm">The
True Dork Times</a> were also resources I used to collect this data. The
Survivor Wiki has data on every single season specifically, while the
True Dork Times link has loads of different categories for neat Survivor
statistics. On the Survivor Wiki, you can access any of the 40 seasons
by clicking on the search bar and typing "Survivor: <em>season
name</em>". So, you could type "Survivor: Gabon" if you want to find
information about Season 17, Gabon. Then, on that page, you can scroll
down and find loads of information about that season including the
winner, the order people were voted out, the vote history, and more.</p>
<p>The "Individual Immunity Wins (Season)" is also an intriguing
category of data because it shows a disparity between men and women in a
specific part of the game, the challenges, which happen every season.
The purspose of this dataset being present is to see if challenges
generally seem to lean towards men's skills more women's skills. <a
href="https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/boxscores/indchw-season.htm">This
page</a> on The True Dork Times was particularly helpful for the
challenge section.</p>
<p>Another interesting piece of data I found is from <a
href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/10/16/survivor-island-of-the-idols-why-do-men-keep-winning/">this
"Entertainment Weekly" article</a>. There are 2 short paragraphs not far
down in the article with compelling data about the gender gap in regards
to jury votes to win the game. In that, in the past 14 seasons of
Survivor, men have received many many more jury votes than women, even
though there are fairly close to an even number of men and women that
have appeared in a final tribal council in that span. I will go into
more specific detail on these numbers in the data analysis section of
this project. This article did not include a dataset directly, so I took
this information, and made a tab in my aforementioned spreadsheet on
Final Tribal Council votes. I also added the remainder of the seasons'
Final Tribal Council stats to that spreadsheet.</p>
<p>With each tab on the spreadsheet, I downloaded it as a .csv file, and
read the file into pandas to create a dataset in Python. So, I will be
using a total of 4 datasets.</p>

<p>From the histogram of all confessional counts of winners, we can see
that the distribution is not normal. Also, a good amount of the values
seem to be between 40-60, with a few values in the 90's. Note that all 3
of those values in the 90's are by men. We will go into a 5-number

numbers.</p>

<p>With the distribution of confessionals not being normally

<p>Wow now this is something. On average by median, a man that wins a
season gets 16 more confessionals than a woman that wins. Another way of
putting it is that a man that wins gets 37.21% more confessionals than a
woman that wins. That's a lot. For every 10 seconds a winning woman gets
to tell of her story, a winning man gets close to 14 seconds. And in the
grand scheme of a whole season, that becomes a considerable difference
in who's perspective of the story is being told.</p>

<p>The boxplot for confessionals by winning men (the blue one on the
right) is generally much higher than the boxplot for confessionals by
winning women. There is not even much overlap between the interqaurtile
ranges for men and women, with the Q1 for men at 48 and the Q3 for women
at 53.5. So, we can see graphically that men who win generally get more
confessionals than women who win and it is by a significant margin.</p>

<p>When men are finding significantly more idols than women and are
winning considerably more challenges than women, these are more
opportunities of power in the game of Survivor that are going to men.
When a player plays an idol or possesses the immunity necklace (from
winning an individual immunity challenge), that player is safe from
receiving any votes for elimination. So, men having these advantages in
the game directly helps them survive longer and gives them a higher
chance to make it to Final Tribal Council, which is where the jury votes
on the last 2/3 players remaining on who should win the game.</p>

men receiving 2 more votes than women (total not individually). Granted
with only 2 or 3 people appearing in FTC, there cannot be multiple men
and multiple women in a FTC in the same season, but the point still
stands that men get more votes on average than women, collectively. But
let's look at the individual numbers.</p>

<p>I turned the raw vote numbers into percentages, to normalize it more

<p>We can see that when the votes come from strictly men versus women
situations, the disparity is even larger. There is almost no overlap
between the Interquartile ranges (Q1 for men is 3 and Q3 for women is
4).</p>
<p>This shows a huge disparity between the spread of votes by gender, as
men just get more votes typically than women do. And this disparity
becomes accentuated when focusing just on the men versus women numbers
of vote collecting. This is because women have more total votes from all
women final 2/3's than men do in all men situations. As in, women more
so need to be against other women to have a better shot to win. Wow,

<p>In the game of Survivor, men have a significant advantage when it
comes to individual immunity challenges and an extremely signifcant
advantage in finding hidden immunity idols. As seen with the statistical
significance tests from earlier, men historically have a higher than 50%
chance of winning challenges and of finding idols. As in, the data shows
an inequality between men and women in these facets of the game. Now,
how directly helpful finding idols and/or winning challenges are to
actually winning the game of Survivor is beyond the scope of what this
project is looking at. But, regardless there is a noticable disparity
between men and women in both of these categories, which is important to
acknowledge.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the game that has a significant disparity between
men and women is the distribution of receiving votes, to win the game,
at Final Tribal Council. On average, each man that appears in a Final
Tribal Council receives 3.93 votes, while each woman receives 2.49
votes, which has led to significantly more men winning the game (25)
than women (15). So, men do have a significant advantage in receiving
votes and furthermore, in receiving respect for the way they played the
game and credit for the strategic moves they made. This correlates to a
substantial problem in the world, the workplace in particular, of women
being treated differently and often respected less. Stereotypes that
build up in the workplace, like men being "allowed" to be more
aggressive or upfront than women, also show up in Survivor. And that can
be seen here with more aggressive men like Tony, Rob, Tom, and Richard
winning and getting respect for their strategic moves, while aggressive
women like Angelina, Chrissy, Aubry, and Dawn do not get that same
respect and lose. There are more specific reasons why each of those men
won and each of those women lost, but the point is still relevant. The
way that women have to conduct themselves is different than the way men
do, both in a real life corporate situation and in the game of
Survivor.</p>
<p>And then with the show of Survivor, there exists a disparity between
how men and women are portrayed. Specifically, with the confessional
counts of men that win versus women that win. On average, a man who wins
gets 16 confessionals more than a woman who wins (59 for men compared to
43 for women). This leans into and perpetuates the previous problem of
men getting more respect and winning at Final Tribal Council more,
especially in recent seasons. With viewers seeing a man who wins get to
explain his story much more, that builds up an inherent perception that
men have more to say and, when we see this much of them, should be
listened to more. This just further digs into stereotypes and gender
roles of men being more aggressive and out front, which is more
"exciting" television, while women "should be" more passive and quiet.
Now there is a relevant factor of entertainment value here, especially
with certain people like Tony and Boston Rob who are these dynamic and
explosive characters that are just entertaining to watch (opinions may
vary). And the producers want to put on as entertaining of a show as
possible. But, women being perceived as "less entertaining", therefore
getting less confessionals, is exactly why this topic is relevant.
Because that represents our inherent perceptions and biases of gender
roles, both in society and in Survivor.</p>
<p>With all of these issues, who is at fault here and how do we remedy
the sexism in Survivor? Is this on producers to include less advantages
that historically benefit men? Is it on the editors to give women more
screen time and not let the men dominate the airtime? Is it the fault of
women for not being better Survivor players and not being dynamic enough
characters to get more airtime? I doubt it, but I think our inherent
bias plays a role there and is a considerably large factor as to why men
are generally perceived as more entertaining, and get more screen
time.</p>
<p>This might come off as more aggressive or critical of the show than I
intend. Survivor is my favorite show and I am obsessed with it (to the
point that I made that extensive spreadsheet), so my criticisms here are
meant with the intent of making something I already love even better.
This is rather an acknowledgement of the flaws in the show and hopefully
a step towards gender equality on Survivor, and in society in
general.</p>
<p>This data project could be seen as a way to lambaste men and put an
asterick next to their achievements in Survivor, which is not the
intention. They do historically have an upperhand in some aspects of the
game, but a multitude of men have done very well in Survivor because of
their own doing. This is more so meant to acknowledge the inherent bias
that the editors, players, and even us as the viewers have when it comes
to gender roles in Survivor.</p>
<p>These results could also be misinterpreted to mean that women should
win every season or that men have no problems in Survivor or in real
life. Neither of these are true. Ideally, there is a near even balance
of men and women winning Survivor and the inherent bias that affects how
people are perceived is minimal. This project does not analyze the parts
of Survivor that hinder men, like how men are often targeted as big
threats around the merge in the game and often get voted out around that
time. This is because the focus is to acknowledge the glaring flaws and
gender disparities, which lie more on the side of issues that impede
women in Survivor.</p>
