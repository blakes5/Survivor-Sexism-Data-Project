    "Let's talk about my favorite television show, Survivor! It's been around for 20 years, it has 40 seasons, and yes, it is still going on (Season 41 is being filmed as I type this!). For those who do not know, Survivor is a reality television show and social strategy game where they put between 16-20 strangers (well, usually strangers) on an island (or desert, rainforest, etc.) and they have to live with each other in their own little society. The fun part about Survivor is they get to vote people off of their tribe and do not live with them anymore. They start off split into (2-4) tribes and have challenges, with the losing tribe going to \"Tribal Council\", the place where they vote someone off. Eventually, they merge into 1 tribe and keep voting people off until there are only 2 or 3 people left. The people who have been voted off make up the jury and they vote for someone in the final 2/3 to win the season. And that's a qick gist of Survivor!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now even though it is my favorite show, it does come with its problems. One of the main ones is an inequality between men and women in Survivor. This exists in both the game of Survivor, in terms of how fair it is for men versus women, as well as in the show of Survivor, in how men versus women are portrayed on television. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there is a monumental distinction to make between the game of Survivor and the show of Survivor. The game of Survivor is what happens out there on the island and how the production behind the scenes controls the game, through different twists and such. While the show of Survivor is the product that we, as the viewer, see on television. The show is a product of what happens in the game (for that season) and is the result of cutting hundreds of hours of footage to display exactly what they want to show to the viewer. This distinction between the game and the show of Survivor is extremely important to clarify for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "That distinction being made, there appears to be inherent sexism in many facets of the game of Survivor that benefit men. And in the show of Survivor that we watch, men are the ones who are more often given more screentime and are given more of a chance to explain their side of the narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, a note on what I mentioned about cutting hundreds of hours of footage and why that matters. Each season lasts 39 days and there are 13 or 14 episodes every season. So, on average, one 42 minute episode contains footage from about 3 days worth of gameplay, or 72 hours. And that is just counting 1 camera ... they have many, many cameras. So, the producers and editors have a boatlad of footage to use however they want to display their reality television characters. This means, not everything shown has to be entirely truthful or presented to us in the correct order that it happened. For example, they could get  clip of Jessica saying how annoying Phillip is on Day 20 and edit that to put it in the episode covering Day 10 and try to build up a (fake) storyline that Jessica wants to get Phillip out on Day 10. And this is the reality of reality television."

    "Survivor can often be viewed as a microcosm of society. As in, the disparity between men and women here in Survivor represents a bigger issue about society as whole. Most of the imbalances that exist in Survivor are because of their existence in society as a whole too, beyond just Survivor. As in, the way women are perceived compared to men in the real world translate to how their are perceived in the context of Survivor. So, when I dive into how women are portrayed on Survivor, that is relevant because it is connected to our pre-conceived beliefs of societal gender roles and has a much bigger impact than just on the game of Survivor. The data and information I will present in this project reflect some of the inherent bias in how we perceive men and women, at least in the more quantifiable ways. This will still be much more of a data-driven project, rather than a philosophical paper on gender roles, but it is important to draw the connection between sexism in Survivor and how that translates to sexism in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the gender roles we see play out in Survivor can even have an impact on society. All 40 seasons of Survivor have pulled in millions of viewers, with [over 50 million in the finale of the first season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series)) back in 2000, to a steady 7-8 million now. So, this is a show that has a [large influence on people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/05/29/survivor-changed-television-forever-and-it-still-endures-whats-the-secret/), [especially in American culture](https://www.theringer.com/tv/2020/5/12/21255075/survivor-legacy-40th-anniversary-reality-tv). The point is, people love Survivor (myself included!). And when people see men get rewarded and women get punished for more aggressive behavior in the game of Survivor, that builds up the narrative that it should be that way in society. This perpetuates the standard of men having power and being in higher-level positions more than women. Of course, there are many more factors beyond just Survivor, but with how large of a following it has, it definitely has an impact on society."

    "Despite all the progress made in the past 100 or so years, sexism is still a prevalent issue in American society, especially in the workplace. Women experience some level of discrimination at work for their gender, with [42% of women](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/12/14/gender-discrimination-comes-in-many-forms-for-todays-working-women/) reporting they have been discriminated against because of their gender. Discrimination comes in the form of women receiving less support from senior leaders than men, receiving unwanted sexual advances from men, and experiencing sexual harassment or abuse in the workplace. Sexism has become so interwoven into the environment of a workplace, that women come to understand it and expect it. [For example](https://www.smartcompany.com.au/people-human-resources/six-common-manifestations-everyday-sexism-work/), women might have to ask a male colleague to propose an idea at a meeting because they know a man's voice might have more volume (social volume, not just being loud) and be listened to more. Or it also comes in the form of asking for a manager and expecting to see a man, even when a woman greets you as the manager. These are just a couple common examples of how sexism exists and is perpetuated in society, specifically in a workplace setting. \n"

    "In Survivor, 2 or 3 players survive long enough to make it to the final tribal council, where the jury (the most recent 8 or so players that have been voted out) votes for who they think should win. Each jury member gets 1 vote and the player with the most votes wins the season. A jury member's reasoning for who he/she votes for really can be whatever that person wants. Often times, it comes down to perception of who played the \"best game\", which takes into account social relationships between players. As the game of Survivor has developed, jury members often base their decisions on who to vote for by considering who should get the credit for social and strategic moves that occur throughout the game. This is where the idea of [women getting less credit than men in the workplace](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/12/171213130252.htm) really reflects itself in Survivor. Analyzing how men versus women are perceived in the final jury vote in Survivor quantifiably represents the potential disparity of credit or respect that women get compared to men in the real world, especially in the workplace. So, when we see women generally receiving less votes to win (at final tribal council), that can be representative of receiving less credit compared to men in a group setting in real life (beyond Survivor). The gender stereotypes that predicate that bias in Survivor are also existent in society, which is what makes the analysis of this question so relevant in today's world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Confessionals are one of the largest components of the show of Survivor. A typical episode of Survivor consists of a mix of confessionals, clips from life at each tribe camp, challenges, and tribal council. Confessionals are how players tell their side of the story to the audience, to give them more perspective on what is happening in the game. By the nature of the game, the winner of the season is around the whole season and is usually included in the episode to, in some sense, explain why he/she is doing this and to narrate along the way how he/she intend to keep going to win the game. This is relevant because seeing how many confessionals men winners versus women winners have can quantify how much of their story they get to tell. For example, if we see 100 confessionals from Rob, we get to see so much of what he was thinking every step of the game. But if we see only 15 confessionals from Miranda, we barely get to see what she is thinking and what her story is. This is relevant beyond Survivor because it represents a bigger issue of the world being [built for men](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/23/truth-world-built-for-men-car-crashes). So many things in the world, like car safety mechanism measurements and police body armour for example, are designed for men. This happens because the perspective of men has been taken to represent humans as a whole. So, when a male winner gets to explain much more of his story in one season than a female winner gets to in another season, this symbolizes a bigger problem of the world being \"set up\" for men. This dichotomy of winning men versus winning women getting confessionals is of concern because it further perpetuates the narrative in life of being from a man's perspective by [several millions of viewers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series)#U.S._television_ratings) of Survivor seeing more men tell the stories than women. And also with [mainly men behind the camera](https://www.truedorktimes.com/s40/recaps/bipoc-stats.htm) and production of the show, their willingness to portray more of men's stories further perpetuates this problem in society and enables it to continue. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the game of Survivor, hidden immunity idols and individual immunity challenges represent an opportunity to gain power in the game. Winning individual immunity guarantees a player's safety from elimination that round of voting, while an idol nullifies all votes against the player it is played for, keeping that person also safe from elimination for that round of voting. This means players who win challenges and/or find idols are in poisitions of power in the game, both with safety for that round, and socially with other players. If men have an advantage in finding idols and winning challenges, then they have an advantage in acquiring social and strategic power in the game of Survivor. This can be representative of an inequality in society, especially in the workplace. Specifically, [men have an easier time getting promotions](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-women-almost-never-become-ceo-2016-9) than women do in the corporate world. Women work in executive positions much less than men do, and for each higher level  position, a [lower percentage of women](https://i.insider.com/5e7d06081378e3047b15a975?width=700&format=jpeg&auto=webp) are working in it. With this structure of men already being in higher level positions more, and those same men being the ones to promote others to higher positions, this perpetuates the cycle of men being the ones in those CEO, VP, Manager roles. Both the corporate structure of America and these facets of the game of Survivor (idols and challenges) seem to historically benefit men, putting them in power positions in the game and in real life.\n",
    "Which is why I want to analyze how men versus women have faired in finding idols and winning individual immunity challenges; because it represents a larger-scale issue of a system that ameliorates men's opportunities. \n",

    "I have been collecting data on various topics in Survivor for the past few years and compiled them [in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gb377DdGNfzct0Nt9BYMF-moLXcxFxhOnePBQhIJ73s/edit?usp=sharing). The pink tabs are the ones I will use for this project, which are \"Confessional Counts of Winners\", \"Idols Found\", \"Individual Immunity Wins (Season)\", and \"Votes at Final Tribal Council\". All of these will be used to answer the research questions \n",
    "\n",
    "A considerable amount of the data in that spreadsheet comes from my own knowledge and memory of having watched every season of Survivior and somehow remembering loads of minute details. While there is plenty of footage that is scrapped and does not make the final cut of the episodes of Survivor, this data is entirely based on concrete events that occur in the episodes that are aired on CBS. The number of confessionals by player, hidden immunity idols found, individual immunity challenges won, votes at final tribal council, and final 4 fire making challenge always occur within the aired episodes. I considered including individual reward challenges (another type of challenge besides immunity that occurs occasionally), but not all reward challenges are always aired in the episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Survivor Wiki](https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) and [The True Dork Times](http://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/boxscores/index.htm) were also resources I used to collect this data. The Survivor Wiki has data on every single season specifically, while the True Dork Times link has loads of different categories for neat Survivor statistics. On the Survivor Wiki, you can access any of the 40 seasons by clicking on the search bar and typing \"Survivor: *season name*\". So, you could type \"Survivor: Gabon\" if you want to find information about Season 17, Gabon. Then, on that page, you can scroll down and find loads of information about that season including the winner, the order people were voted out, the vote history, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Individual Immunity Wins (Season)\" is also an intriguing category of data because it shows a disparity between men and women in a specific part of the game, the challenges, which happen every season. The purspose of this dataset being present is to see if challenges generally seem to lean towards men's skills more women's skills. [This page](https://www.truedorktimes.com/survivor/boxscores/indchw-season.htm) on The True Dork Times was particularly helpful for the challenge section.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another interesting piece of data I found is from [this \"Entertainment Weekly\" article](https://ew.com/tv/2019/10/16/survivor-island-of-the-idols-why-do-men-keep-winning/). There are 2 short paragraphs not far down in the article with compelling data about the gender gap in regards to jury votes to win the game. In that, in the past 14 seasons of Survivor, men have received many many more jury votes than women, even though there are fairly close to an even number of men and women that have appeared in a final tribal council in that span. I will go into more specific detail on these numbers in the data analysis section of this project. This article did not include a dataset directly, so I took this information, and made a tab in my aforementioned spreadsheet on Final Tribal Council votes. I also added the remainder of the seasons' Final Tribal Council stats to that spreadsheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "With each tab on the spreadsheet, I downloaded it as a .csv file, and read the file into pandas to create a dataset in Python. So, I will be using a total of 4 datasets."

Another way of putting it is that a man that wins gets 37.21% more confessionals than a woman that wins. That's a lot. For every 10 seconds a winning woman gets to tell of her story, a winning man gets close to 14 seconds. And in the grand scheme of a whole season, that becomes a considerable difference in who's perspective of the story is being told."

    "We can see that if the probability was 50% for men to find an idol, then it is almost impossible for men to find this many idols. This is well under the significance value of .05, so we can conclude this is statistically significant. As in, the number of idols men have actually found is well beyond men and women each having an even 50% chance of finding an idol. So we can see that this is not equal and men have a significant advantage in finding hidden immunity idols.  "

    "This shows a huge disparity between the spread of votes by gender, as men just get more votes typically than women do.

    "In the game of Survivor, men have a significant advantage when it comes to individual immunity challenges and an extremely signifcant advantage in finding hidden immunity idols. As seen with the statistical significance tests from earlier, men historically have a higher than 50% chance of winning challenges and of finding idols. As in, the data shows an inequality between men and women in these facets of the game. Now, how directly helpful finding idols and/or winning challenges are to actually winning the game of Survivor is beyond the scope of what this project is looking at. But, regardless there is a noticable disparity between men and women in both of these categories, which is important to acknowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect of the game that has a significant disparity between men and women is the distribution of receiving votes, to win the game, at Final Tribal Council. On average, each man that appears in a Final Tribal Council receives 3.93 votes, while each woman receives 2.49 votes, which has led to significantly more men winning the game (25) than women (15). So, men do have a significant advantage in receiving votes and furthermore, in receiving respect for the way they played the game and credit for the strategic moves they made. This correlates to a substantial problem in the world, the workplace in particular, of women being treated differently and often respected less. Stereotypes that build up in the workplace, like men being \"allowed\" to be more aggressive or upfront than women, also show up in Survivor. And that can be seen here with more aggressive men like Tony, Rob, Tom, and Richard winning and getting respect for their strategic moves, while aggressive women like Angelina, Chrissy, Aubry, and Dawn do not get that same respect and lose. There are more specific reasons why each of those men won and each of those women lost, but the point is still relevant. The way that women have to conduct themselves is different than the way men do, both in a real life corporate situation and in the game of Survivor. \n",
    "\n",
    "And then with the show of Survivor, there exists a disparity between how men and women are portrayed. Specifically, with the confessional counts of men that win versus women that win. On average, a man who wins gets 16 confessionals more than a woman who wins (59 for men compared to 43 for women). This leans into and perpetuates the previous problem of men getting more respect and winning at Final Tribal Council more, especially in recent seasons. With viewers seeing a man who wins get to explain his story much more, that builds up an inherent perception that men have more to say and, when we see this much of them, should be listened to more. This just further digs into stereotypes and gender roles of men being more aggressive and out front, which is more \"exciting\" television, while women \"should be\" more passive and quiet. Now there is a relevant factor of entertainment value here, especially with certain people like Tony and Boston Rob who are these dynamic and explosive characters that are just entertaining to watch (opinions may vary). And the producers want to put on as entertaining of a show as possible. But, women being perceived as \"less entertaining\", therefore getting less confessionals, is exactly why this topic is relevant. Because that represents our inherent perceptions and biases of gender roles, both in society and in Survivor.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of these issues, who is at fault here and how do we remedy the sexism in Survivor? Is this on producers to include less advantages that historically benefit men? Is it on the editors to give women more screen time and not let the men dominate the airtime? Is it the fault of women for not being better Survivor players and not being dynamic enough characters to get more airtime? I doubt it, but I think our inherent bias plays a role there and is a considerably large factor as to why men are generally perceived as more entertaining, and get more screen time. \n",
    "\n",
    "This might come off as more aggressive or critical of the show than I intend. Survivor is my favorite show and I am obsessed with it (to the point that I made that extensive spreadsheet), so my criticisms here are meant with the intent of making something I already love even better. This is rather an acknowledgement of the flaws in the show and hopefully a step towards gender equality on Survivor, and in society in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data project could be seen as a way to lambaste men and put an asterick next to their achievements in Survivor, which is not the intention. They do historically have an upperhand in some aspects of the game, but a multitude of men have done very well in Survivor because of their own doing. This is more so meant to acknowledge the inherent bias that the editors, players, and even us as the viewers have when it comes to gender roles in Survivor. \n",
    "\n",
    "These results could also be misinterpreted to mean that women should win every season or that men have no problems in Survivor or in real life. Neither of these are true. Ideally, there is a near even balance of men and women winning Survivor and the inherent bias that affects how people are perceived is minimal. This project does not analyze the parts of Survivor that hinder men, like how men are often targeted as big threats around the merge in the game and often get voted out around that time. This is because the focus is to acknowledge the glaring flaws and gender disparities, which lie more on the side of issues that impede women in Survivor."
